# Goods

In FoE the economy for trading between players is goods.   Each age of play has 5 goods in it.  Each player can produce only 2 of the 5 goods at a rate of 5 per 4 hour period.   The 3 goods a play can produce at a rate of 1 per 4 hour period.   This leads to an environment where guild members, neighbors and friends can be used to trade for the 3 goods per age that you do not produce at the rate of 5 per 4 hour period.

## Same Age Trading

When trading goods, the trades are deemed fair or unfair by FoE.   A fair trade is one that allows for goods to be evenly swapped.  E.g.  If trading an Age's goods for goods of the same Age, it is a 1 for 1 trade.   An unfair trade is anything that isn't expicitly fair.   E.g.  If trading an Age's goods for goods of the same Age it is anything but a 1 for 1 trade.

## Different Age Trading

When trading goods between Ages, the trade are deemed fair or unfair by FoE.   A fair trade is one that allows for goods to be swaped at a rate of 1 higher Age good for 2 lower age goods.  An unfair trade is anything that isnt' explicitly fair.   E.g. Trading 30 Marble for 15 Cloth is fair.

## Mud's definition of Fair trade

Now just because the game says something is fair doesn't mean it really is.   There are two more measures of fairness that FoE doesn't take into effect.   Here are some details:

### Fair trade for Distant Ages

A Mud Fair trade is one where the number of goods being traded is worth the same number of Bronze Age goods for each participant of the trade.

When doing trades between two adjacent Ages, the game allows fair to be 1 higher Age good for 2 lower age good irrespective of the number of ages apart.   When a trade is being asked for that is 2 or more Ages apart, this really should scale but the game doesn't allow it with 1 trade.   E.g. 1 EMA good is really worth 4 Bronze Age goods.   This is because 1 EMA good can be traded for 2 Iron Age goods and 2 Iron Age goods can be traded for 4 Bronze Age goods.

So when a lower age good is offered using the FoE definition of fair for a good of at least 2 Ages higher, a discount is really being requested.   There is no way to correctly weight goods for a trade across 1 Age.

Here is a table with the worth of each Age's Goods against Brozen Age goods:

1 Good of Age | Bronze Age Equivalent
------------ | -------------
BA | 1
IA | 2
EMA | 4
HMA | 8
LMA | 16
CA | 32
InA | 64
PE | 128
ME | 256
PME | 512

So when you request a trade like 20 IA goods for 10 CA goods, the equation works out to 20 IA Goods = 40 BA goods and 10 CA goods = 320 BA goods.   So basically this trade is 40 BA goods for 320 BA goods.   This isn't a fare trade when a lower level Age's goods is being traded for the higher Age's goods because the person taking the penality is the person satisfying the trade.

Now if the higher Age's goods is being offered for the lower Age's goods, this provides a way for the person making the trade to make it more attractive.   E.g. 10 CA goods being traded for 20 LMA goods.   This works out to 320 BA goods being traded for 160 BA goods.  I consider this fair becasue the person offering the trade is the one who offered the discount.  

### Fair trade for Property

I don't practice this for single Age trades but I am starting to weigh looking at this.

Now once you can account for differences in good Age, the next item to account for is differences is the number of squares of property it takes to generate the goods.   Each goods building isn't the same size.    A great example for this is in CA.  The Paper Mill is 6 squares and the Tar Kiln is 15 squares but yet both buildings generate the same number of goods.  So someone with a Paper Mills can have 2.5 Paper Mills for the same space as 1 Tar Kiln.   The player with Paper Mills can generate 60 goods per day but the player with Tar Kilns can only generate 24 goods per day.

So for a trade between Tar and Paper to be fair you need to account for the differences in building size.   So when trading 10 Tar for Paper, the fair number is 25 Paper.  For those of you in CA, you will notice that the market place contains lots of trades where Paper is offered cheaper becuase of this.   It is so cheap to produce that it isn't worth as much.

### Fair trade for Distant Ages and Property 

I am starting to look at this and don't yet fully know how to explain it.   I am starting to learn this one but it will take me some time to figure it out completely.   Once I do, I will post more.   The reason I am looking at this is because I am seeing higher players using it so I have to learn it to compete with them.

Both of the items above can be calculated together for fairness.   Basically account for age difference and property sizes.
