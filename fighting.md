# Auto Battle Tips

Copied from T10W-Phoenix Guild.
My 10 Steps to Using GE “Auto-Battle” 
1. Work to increase your attack boost profile as ‘high’ as possible.
2. Use Tavern Attack Boost before each GE Battle.
3. Needless to day, higher Age forces will rule the day.
4. Same Age forces will rule if attack and defense boosts are higher than opposing forces.
5.  Match bow for bow; rifleman for rifleman, cannon for cannon when using Auto-Battle
6.  Use Rogues and/or Champions only when you cannot match opposing forces and/or the opposing forces are using Rogues and/or Champions; but your forces’ statistics must be superior in every aspect.
7.  Review the statistics (fighting skills) for each opposing force to ensure the statistics of your forces are superior before the battle begins.
8.  One overlooked statistic against any one the opposing forces could cost you the battle.
9.   No matter how high your statistics are, if the opposing force is from a higher Age, you will lose the battle, despite them having lower statistics.
10.  In dual combat ( two waves of opposing forces), higher boosted troops and/or using the “heal” function will allow you to win.
