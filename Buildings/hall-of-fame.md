## Hall of Fame

The Hall of Fame (HoF) provides Crowns to improve guild levels.  The guild improves in level with Crowns.  The higher the guild level the more the benefit for each of the guild members.   A Colonial Age (CA) HoF that is motivated generated 70 crowns per day (or 35 crowns per day unmotivated).  If the guild generated 2500 Crowns per week via GE, a 5 to 6 CA HoFs will double that generation before bonuses.  

Putting the HoF in your town is a personal decision.  If you have the space in your town and value group benefit as much as personal benefit placing a HoF may be a good idea.  If you don't have space, go ahead and skip it
